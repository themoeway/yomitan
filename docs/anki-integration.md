## Anki Integration

Yomitan features automatic flashcard creation for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a free application designed to help you
retain knowledge. This feature requires the prior installation of an Anki plugin called [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect).
Check the respective project page for more information about how to set up this software.

### Flashcard Configuration

Before flashcards can be automatically created, you must configure the templates used to create term and/or kanji notes.
If you are unfamiliar with Anki deck and model management, this would be a good time to reference the [Anki
Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/). In short, you must specify what information should be included in the
flashcards that Yomitan creates through AnkiConnect.

Flashcard fields can be configured with the following steps:

1.  Open the Yomitan options page and scroll down to the section labeled _Anki Options_.
2.  Tick the checkbox labeled _Enable Anki integration_ (Anki must be running with [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) installed).
3.  Select the type of template to configure by clicking on either the _Terms_ or _Kanji_ tabs.
4.  Select the Anki deck and model to use for new creating new flashcards of this type.
5.  Fill the model fields with markers corresponding to the information you wish to include (several can be used at
    once). Advanced users can also configure the actual [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates used to create
    the flashcard contents (this is strictly optional).

When creating your model for Yomitan, _make sure that you pick a unique field to be first_; fields that will
contain `{expression}` or `{character}` are ideal candidates for this. Anki does not allow duplicate flashcards to be
added to a deck by default; it uses the first field in the model to check for duplicates. For example, if you have `{reading}`
configured to be the first field in your model and <ruby>橋<rt>はし</rt></ruby> is already in your deck, you will not
be able to create a flashcard for <ruby>箸<rt>はし</rt></ruby> because they share the same reading.

### Flashcard Creation

Once Yomitan is configured, it becomes trivial to create new flashcards with a single click. You will see the following
icons next to term definitions:

- Clicking ![](../img/btn-add-expression.png) adds the current expression as kanji (e.g. 食べる).
- Clicking ![](../img/btn-add-reading.png) adds the current expression as hiragana or katakana (e.g. たべる).

If "Check for card duplicates" is on, and a card for the current definition already exists in the deck, you will see the following icons instead:

- Adding the current expression: ![](../img/btn-add-duplicate-expression.png)
- Adding as hiragana or katakana: ![](../img/btn-add-duplicate-reading.png)

Below are some troubleshooting tips you can try if you are unable to create new flashcards:

- If all of the buttons appear grayed out, then you should double-check your deck and model configuration settings.
- If no icons appear at all, make sure that Anki is running in the background and that [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) has been installed.
