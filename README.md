# Lesen-tan <!-- omit from toc -->

## Project Introduction

:wave: **A hover dictionary for conjugated languages (German, French, Spanish)** 

This is a fork of the amazing [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan) project for Japanese, and is based on [yomichan-de](https://github.com/seth-js/yomichan-de). Please check out their github repos for more detailed information about the projects themselves.

If you find any issues or simply want to contribute, please open an issue via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Scrub1492/lesen-tan/issues) or find my on Discord under the name cashewnuttynuts.

**Currently Lesen-tan will work with only German. It will currently have unintended results when performing look-ups in other languages (including Japanese).
