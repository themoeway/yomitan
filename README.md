## Project Introduction

:wave: **This project is a community fork of Yomichan** (which was [sunset](https://foosoft.net/posts/sunsetting-the-yomichan-project/) by its owner on Feb 26 2023).

We have made a number of foundational changes to ensure **the project stays alive, works on latest browser versions, and is easy to contribute to**:

- Completed the Manifest V2 → Manifest V3 transition, which is required to submit a new extension to the Chrome webstore. It will also be long-term required for usage of the extension, as [Manifest V2 extensions will start being disabled as early as June 2024](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/).
- Switched to using ECMAScript modules and npm-sourced dependencies to make for a more modern coding and packaging experience.
- Implemented an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline to make it easy to rapidly iterate and deploy new versions.
- Switched to standard testing frameworks, vitest and playwright, to make it easier to develop more comprehensive tests, and detect regressions.

In addition, we are beginning to make important bug fixes and minor enhancements:

- Improve dictionary import speed by 2x~10x or more (depending on the dictionary)
- Fix UI regressions on modern browser versions, like [the popup being too small](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/pull/228)
- Add functionality to import/export multiple dictionaries, to make your data more portable across machines
- And [more](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-label%3Aarea%2Fdependencies+-label%3Akind%2Fmeta)

Since the owner requested forks be uniquely named, we have chosen a new name, _yomitan_. (_-tan_ is an honorific used for anthropomorphic moe characters.) While we've made some substantial changes, the majority of the extension's functionality is thanks to hard work of foosoft and numerous other open source contributors from 2016-2023.

Since this is a distributed effort, we **highly welcome new contributors**! Feel free to browse the issue tracker, and you can find us on [TheMoeWay Discord](https://discord.gg/UGNPMDE7zC) at [#yomitan-development](https://discord.com/channels/617136488840429598/1081538711742844980).

## Tool Introduction

Yomitan turns your web browser into a tool for building Japanese language literacy by helping you to decipher texts
which would be otherwise too difficult tackle. This extension is similar to
[10ten Japanese Reader (formerly Rikaichamp)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10ten-ja-reader/) for Firefox and
[Rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en) for Chrome, but it
stands apart in its goal of being an all-encompassing learning tool as opposed to a mere browser-based dictionary.

Yomitan provides advanced features not available in other browser-based dictionaries:

- Interactive popup definition window for displaying search results.
- On-demand audio playback for select dictionary definitions.
- Kanji stroke order diagrams are just a click away for most characters.
- Custom search page for easily executing custom search queries.
- Support for multiple dictionary formats including [EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) via the [Yomitan Import](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan-import) tool.
- Automatic note creation for the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard program via the [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) plugin.
- Clean, modern code makes it easy for developers to [contribute](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) new features.

## Installation

Yomitan comes in two flavors: _stable_ and _testing_. Over the years, this extension has evolved to contain many
complex features which have become increasingly difficult to test across different browsers, versions, and environments.
New changes are initially introduced into the _testing_ version, and after some time spent ensuring that they are
relatively bug free, they will be promoted to the _stable_ version. If you are technically savvy and don't mind
submitting issues on GitHub, try the _testing_ version; otherwise, the _stable_ version will be your best bet.

- **Google Chrome**

  - [stable](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomitan/likgccmbimhjbgkjambclfkhldnlhbnn)
  - [testing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomitan-development-build/glnaenfapkkecknnmginabpmgkenenml)

- **Mozilla Firefox**
  - [stable](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomitan/)
  - [testing](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/releases) ※

※ NOTE: Unlike Chrome, Firefox does not allow extensions meant for testing to be hosted in the marketplace.
You will have to download a desired version and side-load it yourself. You only need to do this once and will get
updates automatically.

## Migrating from Yomichan

### Exporting Data

If you are an existing user of Yomichan, you can export your dictionary collection and settings such that they can be imported into Yomitan to reflect your setup exactly as it was.

You can export your settings from Yomichan's Settings page. Go to the `Backup` section and click on `Export Settings`.

Yomichan doesn't have first-class support to export the dictionary collection. Please follow the instructions provided in the following link to export your data:
https://github.com/themoeway/yomichan-data-exporter#steps-to-export-the-data

You can then import the exported files into Yomitan from the `Backup` section of the `Settings` page. Please see [the section on importing dictionaries](#importing-dictionaries) further below for more explicit steps.

### Custom Templates

If you do not use custom templates for Anki note creation, this section can be skipped.

Due to security concerns, an alternate implementation of Handlebars is being used which behaves slightly differently.
This revealed a bug in four of Yomitan's template helpers, which have now been fixed in the default templates. If your
custom templates use the following helpers, please ensure their use matches the corrected forms.

| Helper           | Example                                                       | Corrected                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `formatGlossary` | `{{#formatGlossary ../dictionary}}{{{.}}}{{/formatGlossary}}` | `{{formatGlossary ../dictionary .}}` |
| `furigana`       | `{{#furigana}}{{{definition}}}{{/furigana}}`                  | `{{furigana definition}}`            |
| `furiganaPlain`  | `{{~#furiganaPlain}}{{{.}}}{{/furiganaPlain~}}`               | `{{~furiganaPlain .~}}`              |
| `dumpObject`     | `{{#dumpObject}}{{{.}}}{{/dumpObject}}`                       | `{{dumpObject .}}`                   |

Authors of custom templates may be interested to know that other helpers previously used and documented in the block
form (e.g. `{{#set "key" "value"}}{{/set}}`), while not broken by this change, may also be replaced with the less verbose
form (e.g. `{{set "key" "value"}}`). The default templates and helper documentation have been changed to reflect this.

## Dictionaries

There are several free Japanese dictionaries available for Yomitan, with two of them having glossaries available in
different languages. You must download and import the dictionaries you wish to use in order to enable Yomitan
definition lookups. If you have proprietary EPWING dictionaries that you would like to use, check the [Yomitan
Import](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan-import) page to learn how to convert and import them into Yomitan.

Be aware that non-English dictionaries contain fewer entries than their English counterparts. Even if your primary
language is not English, you may consider also importing the English version for better coverage.

- [Jitendex](https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex) - Jitendex is an improved version of JMdict for Yomitan. It features better formatting and some other improvements, and is actively being improved by its author.
- [JMdict](https://github.com/themoeway/jmdict-yomitan#jmdict-for-yomitan-1) - There are daily automatically updated builds of JMdict for Yomitan available in this repository. It is available in multiple languages and formats, but we recommend installing the more modern Jitendex for English users.
- [JMnedict](https://github.com/themoeway/jmdict-yomitan#jmnedict-for-yomitan) - JMnedict is a dictionary that lists readings of person/place/organization names and other proper nouns.
- [KANJIDIC](https://github.com/themoeway/jmdict-yomitan#kanjidic-for-yomitan) - KANJIDIC is an English dictionary listing readings, meanings, and other info about kanji characters.

## Basic Usage

1.  Click the <img src="ext/images/yomitan-icon.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _Yomitan_ button in the browser bar to open the quick-actions popup.

    <img src="resources/images/browser-action-popup1.png" alt="">

    - The <img src="ext/images/cog.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _cog_ button will open the Settings page.
    - The <img src="ext/images/magnifying-glass.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _magnifying glass_ button will open the Search page.
    - The <img src="ext/images/question-mark-circle.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _question mark_ button will open the Information page.
    - The <img src="ext/images/profile.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _profile_ button will appear when multiple profiles exist, allowing the current profile to be quickly changed.

2.  Import the dictionaries you wish to use for term and kanji searches. If you do not have any dictionaries installed
    or enabled, Yomitan will warn you that it is not ready for use by displaying an orange exclamation mark over its
    icon. This exclamation mark will disappear once you have installed and enabled at least one dictionary.

    <img src="resources/images/settings-dictionaries-popup.png" alt="">

3.  Webpage text can be scanned by moving the cursor while holding a modifier key, which is <kbd>Shift</kbd>
    by default. If definitions are found for the text at the cursor position, a popup window containing term definitions
    will open. This window can be dismissed by clicking anywhere outside of it.

    <img src="resources/images/search-popup-terms.png" alt="">

4.  Click on the <img src="ext/images/play-audio.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _speaker_ button to hear the term pronounced by a native speaker. If an audio sample is
    not available, you will hear a short click instead. You can configure the sources used to retrieve audio samples in
    the options page.

5.  Click on individual kanji in the term definition results to view additional information about those characters,
    including stroke order diagrams, readings, meanings, as well as other useful data.

### Importing Dictionaries

You can import individual dictionaries from the settings page as described above.

Yomitan also supports exporting and importing your entire collection of dictionaries.

#### Importing a Dictionary Collection

- Go to Yomitan's Settings page (Click on the extension's icon then click on the cog icon from the popup)
- Click `Import Dictionary Collection` and select the database file you want to import
- Wait for the import to finish then turn all the dictionaries back on from the `Dictionaries > Configure installed and enabled dictionaries` section
- Refresh the browser tab to see the dictionaries in effect

#### Exporting the Dictionary Collection

- Click `Export Dictionary Collection` from the backup section of Yomitan's settings page
- It will show you a progress report as it exports the data then initiates a
  download for a file named something like `yomitan-dictionaries-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.json`
  (e.g. `yomitan-dictionaries-2023-07-05-02-42-04.json`)

### Importing and Exporting Personal Configuration

Note that you can also similarly export and import your Yomitan settings from the `Backup` section of the Settings page.

You should be able to replicate your exact Yomitan setup across devices by exporting your settings and dictionary collection from the source device then importing those from the destination.

## Custom Dictionaries

Yomitan supports the use of custom dictionaries, including the esoteric but popular
[EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) format. They were often utilized in portable electronic dictionaries
similar to the ones pictured below. These dictionaries are often sought after by language learners for their correctness
and excellent coverage of the Japanese language.

Unfortunately, as most of the dictionaries released in this format are proprietary, they are unable to be bundled with
Yomitan. Instead, you will need to procure these dictionaries yourself and import them using [Yomitan
Import](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan-import). Check the project page for additional details.

## Anki Integration

Yomitan features automatic flashcard creation for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a free application designed to help you
retain knowledge. This feature requires the prior installation of an Anki plugin called [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect).
Check the respective project page for more information about how to set up this software.

### Flashcard Configuration

Before flashcards can be automatically created, you must configure the templates used to create term and/or kanji notes.
If you are unfamiliar with Anki deck and model management, this would be a good time to reference the [Anki
Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/). In short, you must specify what information should be included in the
flashcards that Yomitan creates through AnkiConnect.

Flashcard fields can be configured with the following steps:

1.  Open the Yomitan options page and scroll down to the section labeled _Anki Options_.
2.  Tick the checkbox labeled _Enable Anki integration_ (Anki must be running with [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) installed).
3.  Select the type of template to configure by clicking on either the _Terms_ or _Kanji_ tabs.
4.  Select the Anki deck and model to use for new creating new flashcards of this type.
5.  Fill the model fields with markers corresponding to the information you wish to include (several can be used at
    once). Advanced users can also configure the actual [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates used to create
    the flashcard contents (this is strictly optional).

When creating your model for Yomitan, _make sure that you pick a unique field to be first_; fields that will
contain `{expression}` or `{character}` are ideal candidates for this. Anki does not allow duplicate flashcards to be
added to a deck by default; it uses the first field in the model to check for duplicates. For example, if you have `{reading}`
configured to be the first field in your model and <ruby>橋<rt>はし</rt></ruby> is already in your deck, you will not
be able to create a flashcard for <ruby>箸<rt>はし</rt></ruby> because they share the same reading.

### Flashcard Creation

Once Yomitan is configured, it becomes trivial to create new flashcards with a single click. You will see the following
icons next to term definitions:

- Clicking ![](img/btn-add-expression.png) adds the current expression as kanji (e.g. 食べる).
- Clicking ![](img/btn-add-reading.png) adds the current expression as hiragana or katakana (e.g. たべる).

Below are some troubleshooting tips you can try if you are unable to create new flashcards:

- Individual icons will appear grayed out if a flashcard cannot be created for the current definition (e.g. it already exists in the deck).
- If all of the buttons appear grayed out, then you should double-check your deck and model configuration settings.
- If no icons appear at all, make sure that Anki is running in the background and that [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) has been installed.

### Parse sentences using MeCab

[MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) is a third-party program which uses its own dictionaries and parsing algorithm to decompose sentences into individual words. MeCab may provide more accurate parsing results than Yomitan's internal parser.

In order for Yomitan to use it, both MeCab and a native messaging component must be installed.
A setup guide can be found [here](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan-mecab-installer/blob/master/README.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I can't scan text in Firefox!**

In Firefox's Manifest V3, host permissions are treated as opt-in. For Yomitan to work properly, the recommended permissions
must be explicitly set. Go to the `Recommended Permissions (Important)`section and check `Enable recommended permissions`.

**I'm having problems importing dictionaries in Firefox, what do I do?**

Yomitan uses the cross-browser IndexedDB system for storing imported dictionary data into your user profile. Although
everything "just works" in Chrome, depending on settings, Firefox users can run into problems due to browser bugs.
Yomitan catches errors and tries to offer suggestions about how to work around Firefox issues, but in general at least
one of the following solutions should work for you:

- Make sure you have cookies enabled. It appears that disabling them also disables IndexedDB for some reason. You
  can still have cookies be disabled on other sites; just make sure to add the Yomitan extension to the whitelist of
  whatever tool you are using to restrict cookies. You can get the extension "URL" by looking at the address bar when
  you have the search page open.
- Make sure that you have sufficient disk space available on the drive Firefox uses to store your user profile.
  Firefox limits the amount of space that can be used by IndexedDB to a small fraction of the disk space actually
  available on your computer.
- Make sure that you have history set to "Remember history" enabled in your privacy settings. When this option is
  set to "Never remember history", IndexedDB access is once again disabled for an inexplicable reason.
- As a last resort, try using the [Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-preferences-fix-problems)
  feature to reset your user profile. It appears that the Firefox profile system can corrupt itself preventing
  IndexedDB from being accessible to Yomitan.

**Will you add support for online dictionaries?**

Online dictionaries will not be implemented because it is not possible to support them in a robust way. In order to
perform Japanese deinflection, Yomitan must execute dozens of database queries for every single word. Factoring in
network latency and the fragility of web scraping, it would not be possible to maintain a good and consistent user
experience.

**Is it possible to use Yomitan with files saved locally on my computer with Chrome?**

In order to use Yomitan with local files in Chrome, you must first tick the _Allow access to file URLs_ checkbox
for Yomitan on the extensions page. Due to the restrictions placed on browser addons in the WebExtensions model, it
will likely never be possible to use Yomitan with PDF files.

**Is it possible to delete individual dictionaries without purging the database?**

Yomitan is able to delete individual dictionaries, but keep in mind that this process can be _very_ slow and can
cause the browser to become unresponsive. The time it takes to delete a single dictionary can sometimes be roughly
the same as the time it originally took to import, which can be significant for certain large dictionaries.

**Why aren't EPWING dictionaries bundled with Yomitan?**

The vast majority of EPWING dictionaries are proprietary, so they are unfortunately not able to be included in
this extension due to copyright reasons.

**When are you going to add support for $MYLANGUAGE?**

Developing Yomitan requires a decent understanding of Japanese sentence structure and grammar, and other languages
are likely to have their own unique set of rules for syntax, grammar, inflection, and so on. Supporting additional
languages would not only require many additional changes to the codebase, it would also incur significant maintenance
overhead and knowledge demands for the developers. Therefore, suggestions and contributions for supporting
new languages will be declined, allowing Yomitan's focus to remain Japanese-centric.
